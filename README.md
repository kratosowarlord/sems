This is the application made by Karan Kaushal

This is a web app created to manage the Sports event management for any particular institution.

The organizer can access the students registered for his/her event and verify the information. With the admin/Organizer portal, one can view the current events, Registered students and complaints of the participants. On the Participant portal, one can view all the ongoing and future events and register for the same.  This increases accountability and ease of access for the end user.


With the help of Azure Virtual machines, the accountability, security and end to end control increases. With the help of network interfaces, admin can easily control the inbound and outbound traffic. It also helps to maintain the abrupt users on the platform.
